## Repository Description

An app running in Windows 10 on the .NET MAUI framework. This project looks to provide a solution for my current workplace to migrate from a VBA Microsoft Access SQL-Express hosted database to a stand-alone application with greater versatility and customizability. 
The Project is designed to be able to run independent from Microsoft access while still being able to use database features on various computers. Database information should have different records accessible to different users at the same time with updates send as items are edited and subsequently closed (updated).

This project was hand-built in tandem with a programming class taught by Epicodus. It contains use the technologies and programs listed below.

Additionally a time catalogue of various attempts and explorations can be viewed at "Capstone Research Timeline" in the Markdown files.


## Technologies Used (Proposed)

- C#
- .NET
-  .NET MAUI
- XAML
- Bootstrap
- Git
- Github
- Markdown
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (migrating from SQLExpress)
- VirtualBox (VM Environment) for sandboxing old database/testing compatibility
	* VBA
	* SQL
	* Microsoft Access
	* Google Pixel VM
- TreeSheets
- VS Code
- WindowsUserAuth
- * WinUI (Possibly via MAUI)


## Installation And Setup

Project is currently not in a fully operational state and as such an installation guide for Visual Studio and the appropriate MAUI packages will not result in a functional program.

## Known Bugs

	Project is currently in a partially working state though lacks a migration in order to interact with database. Latest CRUD functionality was somewhat responsive but selection on splashpage is currently unavailable.
